🚢 Predictive Modeling with Titanic Data: A Machine Learning Project 🚢  I’m excited to share my latest project where I applied machine learning techniques to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic disaster! 🧳🔍
Titanic Survival Prediction - Machine Learning Project
Welcome to my Titanic Survival Prediction project! 🎉 In this project, I built a predictive model to determine which passengers survived the Titanic disaster using machine learning.

🚀 Project Overview
This project involves:

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
Feature Engineering: Extracted titles from passenger names and created new features like FamilySize and IsAlone.
Model Building: Trained and evaluated two machine learning models (Logistic Regression and Random Forest) to predict survival outcomes.
Model Evaluation: Evaluated models using classification metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
Final Model: The Random Forest model was chosen for final predictions.
🧳 Key Insights & Learnings
How to preprocess data for machine learning.
Feature engineering to improve model performance.
Comparing and selecting the best model based on evaluation metrics.
💻 Technologies Used
Python
pandas, numpy, scikit-learn
Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualization)
Jupyter Notebook (for analysis)
You can find the full code, analysis, and model building steps in the repository.

Feel free to fork this repo, contribute, or use the code for your own projects!
